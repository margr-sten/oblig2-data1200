      Surveying the atmospheres of planets beyond the solar system, such as those in the TRAPPIST-1 system 
      (artist's concept of four of the system's seven planets shown), could turn up interesting molecules that 
      might indicate life. But ruling out false positives will be a challenge.</p>
  </div>
  <p> In June, astronomers reported a disappointing discovery: The James Webb Space Telescope failed to find a 
    thick atmosphere around the rocky planet TRAPPIST-1 C, an exoplanet in one of the most tantalizing 
    planetary systems in the search for alien life. 
  </p>

    <p>The finding follows similar news regarding neighboring planet TRAPPIST-1 B, another planet in the TRAPPIST-
      1 system. Its dim, red star hosts seven rocky worlds, a few of which are in the habitable zone—at a distance 
      from their star at which liquid water could exist on their surfaces and otherworldly life might thrive.
    </p>

    <p>What it would take to detect that life, if it exists, isn't a new question. But thanks to the JWST, it's finally 
      becoming a practical one. In the next few years, the telescope could glimpse the atmospheres of several 
      promising planets orbiting distant stars. Hidden away in the chemistry of those atmospheres may be the first 
      hints of life beyond our solar system. This presents a sticky problem: What qualifies as a true chemical 
      signature of life?
    </p>

    <p>“You're trying to take very little information about a planet and make a conclusion that is potentially quite 
      profound—changing our view of the whole universe,” says planetary scientist Joshua Krissansen-Totton of 
      the University of Washington.
    </p>

    <p>To detect such a biosignature, scientists must find clever ways to work with the limited information they can 
      glean by observing exoplanets.</p>

    <h2 class="h2.sub-heading"> Chemicals in context</h2>
    <p>Even the most powerful telescopes, including the JWST, almost never “see” exoplanets—by and large, 
      astronomers know these distant worlds only by the flickering of their stars.</p>

      <p>Instead of viewing planets directly, astronomers train their telescopes on stars and wait for planets 
        to “transit,” or pass between, their sun and the telescope. As a planet transits, a bit of starlight filters 
        through its atmosphere and dims the star at certain wavelengths, depending on the chemicals in the 
        atmosphere. The resulting dips and peaks in the star's brightness are like a chemical barcode for the 
        transiting planet.</p>

            When a planet is in front of its star, some of the starlight is absorbed by molecules in the planet's 
            atmosphere. A telescope trained on the star observes the light that is not absorbed; this creates a 
            spectrum with dips where the light is missing. Above, each dip is the signature of a particular molecule 
            in the spectrum of a hypothetical Earth-like exoplanet.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Perhaps the most intuitive way to look for a biosignature in that barcode is to scour it for a gas that was 
          clearly produced by life. For a time scientists thought that oxygen, which is abundant on Earth because of 
          photosynthesis, served as a stand-alone biosignature. But oxygen can arise from other processes: Sunlight 
          could break apart water in the planet's atmosphere, for example.</p>

        <p>And that problem isn't unique to oxygen—most of the gases that living things produce can also arise 
            without life. So instead of treating single gases as biosignatures in their own right, scientists 
            today tend to consider them in context.</p>

        <p>Methane, for instance, can be produced both with and without life. It wouldn't be a convincing 
          biosignature on its own. But finding methane and oxygen together “would be hugely exciting,” says 
          planetary scientist Robin Wordsworth of Harvard University; it's very difficult to produce that 
          combination without life. Likewise, work by Krissansen-Totton and colleagues recently showed that 
          finding methane along with the right amounts of other gases, such as carbon dioxide, would be hard 
          to explain without life.</p>

        <p>Watching how an exoplanet atmosphere changes over time might also provide valuable context that 
          could strengthen otherwise weak biosignatures. Seasonal variations in the concentration of ozone, 
          for example, could be a fingerprint of life, scientists reported in 2018.</p>

        <h2 class="h2.sub-heading">Surprises, not assumptions</h2>

        <p>Of course, “if you're looking for individual gases like oxygen or methane, then built into that 
          are assumptions about what type of life is elsewhere,” says Krissansen-Totton. So some scientists 
          are developing agnostic biosignatures that don't assume alien biochemistry will be anything like 
          Earth's biochemistry.</p>
